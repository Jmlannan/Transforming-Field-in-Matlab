# Transforming-Field-in-Matlab
Using Lorentz transforms in Matlab
Run the DipoleCharge or the graphing the point charge scripts to create some graphs.
You can edit values like the v=.5 to any value of velocity as a ratio of the speed of light.
You can also change the values of the charges, make different systems of charges and much more, play around with it.
